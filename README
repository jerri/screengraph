Screen-Graph
------------

This is a simple tool to use screen and gnuplot, to output a simple graph of
one changing number output in a window.

This script is a bash-file, which uses quite a lot of common tools. Namely:

- bash
- gnuplot
- sed
- perl
- gnu screen

I think it's not very elegant, as I hacked this together in about 2 hours to
check a new tool I have programmed. But it works. Although YMMV!

Usage
-----

You need at least one screen running. Check for the $STY, as you need this for
screen-graph to find the data. So in the running screen do:

$ echo $STY
2294.pts-0.fun

The create a window in screen and give it a title. With standard-shortcuts that
whould be: ctrl-a c (to create a new window). ctrl-a :title aname[RETURN] to
set the title.

Now in that window output your data. The format has to be:

UNIX-TIMESTAMP yourValue

Here is a simple example to track your load:

$ while true; do echo -n $(date +%s)' '; cat /proc/loadavg | cut -f 1 -d ' '; sleep 10; done

The output should look like something like this this:

1144870745 0.22
1144870755 0.18
1144870765 0.39
1144870775 0.64
1144870785 0.85

OK. Now comes the magic. In another window, or even in another terminal (on the
same computer as the same user!) do (with screen-graph.sh in your PATH!)

$ screen-graph.sh 2294.pts-0.fun aname

Use the values you got before! The result should be an graph filling up your
terminal. If it doesn't work. Well. Use the source, luke. :)
